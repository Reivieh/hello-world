My first steps into a new world

Hi all,
my name is Dirk. I'm a 41y old man from germany. I was born in Aachen, but now I live in Frankfurt.
My first apprenticeship was at the Bundeswehr as a communication electronics technician. Right after my apprenticeship I served in the Bundeswehr for almost a year. During my duty and my education I had my first contact with IT in business, besides my experiences wich i gathered in my spare time. Over the years I did some different jobs, and after my girlfriend and I had to move from Munich to Frankfurt, I decided to take some efforts to finally get into the IT business. She was working as a software quality engineer since we moved to Munich in 2008, so I was able to learn about this business.
I began to read about software testing and started to learn the stuff all by myself, and finally I made a certification according to the ISTQB standard. After some struggling to find a job in the testing business I got an employment in my actual company, and now I'm going trough some more stuff upcoming to me to get the job done.
